# prob
prob: Probability on Finite Sample Spaces

## Install

Until the package is republished on CRAN the quickest and easiest way to install is this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("combinat")  # prob depends on combinat
devtools::install_github("gjkerns/prob")
```

Obviously you will need to install the `devtools` package if you do no have it already.
