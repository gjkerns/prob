# prob: Elementary Probability on Finite Sample Spaces

## Install

This package is not on CRAN.  The quickest and easiest way to install is this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("combinat")  # prob depends on combinat
devtools::install_github("gjkerns/prob")
```

Obviously you will need to install the `devtools` package if you do not have it already.
